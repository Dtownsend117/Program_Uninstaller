# Program_Uninstaller
A simple Python module for listing software to uninstall

This module will list all software on the system in numerical order and allow you to pick a single program to uninstall
You will need a code editor, I recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code
This starts the uninstall process, you will need to confirm or deny the uninstall manually
